  <p align="center">
    Hey! I am Juan Paulo Feliciano. A Web Developer, Gym Junkie, and a Tech Enthusiast. <br />
    I've been looking for a company where I can better hone the skills that I already have, while also
    learning new ones. I am a man of knowledge. I am curious. I love learning, and I think Elevation Partners
    is the right choice for me.

    My proudest moment is when I developed a <b>Web Application for clinics</b>. <br />
    Have you tried going to the clinic, where they give you a paper and you need to pass it on to different counters? We waste a lot of ink and paper daily, which is why I developed an application to help make clinics go paper-less. <br />
    Basically, what it does is it transfers data from the application to the machine itself, making the process paper-less. I had a lot of struggle while developing the application. I also had to learn a lot about open-source software and how to integrate them into my application. <br />
    I was also the one who deployed them personally on site. I managed the clinic's server using Vsphere. Made sure that it is running properly 24/7 while doing some updates and upgrades.
